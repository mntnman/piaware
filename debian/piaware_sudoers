# This is a sample sudoers file to allow piaware to run commands with
# root privileges. The commands are typically run from a hook script
# contained in /etc/piaware.hooks/

# By default everything is disabled. To enable particular commands, uncomment
# them. It's up to you what you allow piaware to do!

# These rules assume that piaware runs as the user "piaware". If you have
# changed the configuration to run as some other user, you will need to
# update the username here too.
